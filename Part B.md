The Impact of the Covid-19 Outbreak on SMEs




As a result of my research, I examine how the education and training periods of the countries continue.I examined the educational situations in 4 categories

The categories tracked are:

Closed due to COVID-19: Government-mandated closures of educational institutions affecting most or all of the student population enrolled from pre-primary through to upper secondary levels [ISCED levels 0 to 3]. In most cases, various distance learning strategies are deployed to ensure educational continuity.

Academic break: Most schools across the country are on scheduled academic breaks for periods of at least four weeks. All study during this period is suspended.

Fully open: For the majority of schools, classes are being held exclusively in person, noting that measures to ensure safety and hygiene in schools vary considerably from context to context and/or by level of education.

Partially open: Governments have mandated (a) partial reopening in certain areas, and/or (b) a phased re-opening by grade level or age and/or (c) the use of a hybrid approach combining in-person and distance learning. It also includes the countries where national governments have deferred decisions on re-opening to other administrative units (e.g. region, municipality or individual schools), and where a variety of re-opening modalities are being used.
